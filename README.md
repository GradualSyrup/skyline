# Skyline
An enviroment for linking, runtime hooking and code patching in Super Smash Bros Ultimate

# Usage
1. Head to the Release page
2. Download the latest release (skyline.zip)
3. Copy the ``exefs`` directory on your SD in the following directory: ``atmosphere/contents/<game titleid>/``
4. Remove the ''main.npdm'' file from the newly added directory unless you are modding ``Super Smash Bros. Ultimate``.  
This file has to be made on a game-by-game basis and will usually be provided by plugin makers or made yourself using a mix of ``HACTool`` and ``npdmtool``.
5. If you wish to install a plugin, drop it in the following directory: ``atmosphere/contents/<game titleid>/romfs/skyline/plugins/``

# Compatibility issues
Skyline's way of initializing is not compatible with every game out of the box due to various reasons that can't be anticipated.  
Mod developers might sometimes modify Skyline to make it compatible with a specific game which you should use if you are running into crashes.
